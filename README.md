# Diet Scanner

A web application that parses ingredients for adherence to preselected dietary preferences.


## Description

The Diet Scanner web application allows for users to select a dietary preference such as Plant-based,
Vegetarian, and Celiac, and then input a list of ingredients so that the app can check their ingredients
against a predefined list of non-adhering ingredients for their selected diet. The goal of the Diet Scanner
is to make it easier for those following a diet to avoid specific ingredients.
